# Simulation of a Cellular Telephony Network

## Problem statement
The telecommunication company XPhone has been receiving complaints from its subscribers
regarding quality of service (QoS) along a 40 km long highway connecting two major cities.
The highway is covered by its cellular telephony network. The company needs to decide
whether or not its system guarantees quality of service (QoS) in terms of percentages of
dropped calls and blocked calls. Some measurements have been made of the traffic in the
network on the highway. Your task is to model and simulate the system to determine
whether the system can meet the quality of service requirements, and if so, which fixed
channel allocation scheme offers the best service.

## Quality of Service (QoS) Requirements
* blocked calls < 2%; and
* dropped calls < 1%

## System Descriptions
The two-way highway is 40 km long. The company uses 20 base stations, each covers a cell
with 2 km diameter as shown in the figure below. There is no overlapping of cells. Where
the reach of one base station ends, the reach of the next base station starts. Each base station
has 10 channels so there are 10 channels available in each cell.

When a subscriber initiates a call from within a cell, a channel in the cell will be allocated to
the call. If no free channels are available in the base station, the call is blocked. When a
subscriber making a call crosses a cell boundary before the end of the 40-km highway, the
channel being used in the current cell is released and a new channel in the new cell has to be
acquired: this is called a Handover. If a channel is not available in the new base station
during a handover the call is dropped. When a subscriber making a call crosses the end of the
40-km highway (either end), the call will be terminated and the channel being used is
released.

A Fixed Channel Allocation (FCA) scheme is used. The company wants you to test at least
two FCA schemes:
1. No channel reservation
2. 9 channels are allocated to each cell for new calls and handovers and 1 channel is
reserved for handovers when the other 9 channels are not available. This means a new
call will not be allocated a channel if there is only one free channel left.

The company has provided the following measurements:
1. Call initiation times and their first base stations
2. Call durations
3. Car speeds.

Assumptions
1. The traffic volumes in the two directions are the same. This means the two directions of
cars travelling along the highway have equal probabilities.
2. A car maintains the same speed during a call.
3. The position of the car initiating a call in a cell is uniformly distributed along the section
of the highway covered by the base station.

## Your Task
1. Analyze the measured data to find what distributions the inter-arrival times of calls, the
locations where calls are generated, the call durations, and car speeds follow
respectively. You also need to find the parameter values of these distributions. (The
measured data are provided in the file “PCS_TEST_DETERMINSTIC”)
2. Develop a discrete-event simulator.
3. Run your simulator multiple times, each with a warm-up period for different FCA
schemes to investigate how handover reservation scheme may affect the quality of
service (i.e., blocking and dropping probabilities). Calculate the average values of the
percentages of dropped calls and blocked calls and indicate the statistical significance.
Answer the following questions: Is the current system able to meet the quality of service
requirements and if so how many channels should be reserved for handover for best
service? (The percentage of dropped calls is defined as the number of dropped calls
divided by the total number of calls; and the percentage of blocked calls is defined as the
number of blocked calls divided by the total number of calls.)

## Analysis and Implementation
1. Pseudocode for the simulation program can be found from `pseudocode` folder, including one for 
Event-Scheduling simulation and one for Process-Oriented simulation
2. Analysis works include Input Modeling, Warm-Up Analysis, and Output Analysis, which can be found from `analysis` folder.
3. Implementation of the Event-Scheduling simulation can be found from `simulation` folder.
